# Pi
This is a collision simulation I created after watching a 3Blue1Brown video to calculae the digits of Pi. It assumes the environment to be completely frictionless and the perfectly elastic collision perfectly maintain the law of conservation of energy and the law of conservation of momentum.

You can pretty much go up to 11 digits of Pi but since it's rendered in the broweser it'll get _really_ slow. You can change the number of digits you want to calculate by changing the value of the ```digits``` variable in ```main.js```. Remember to increase the value of ```timeSteps``` as well. Typically you'd add an extra zero with every increment of digit.

This has been fun. Peace lads. Don't expect me to make this responsive or anything. It's literally just a maths experiment.

Go to vanajmoorthy.com/pi to run this or clone this/download it and open ```index.html``` (you can mess around with the values if you do this).
